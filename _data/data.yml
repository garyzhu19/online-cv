    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Ever since competing in robotics, I have been passionate about technology and innovation.
      I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Applied Science (Electrical Engineering) with Co-Op experiences.
      I have done two internships during my undergraduate studies. 
        - My first internship was at a PCB fabrication firm, where I did computer aid design for printed circuit boards. 
        - My second intership was software engineering where I created and improved software for products and internal testing equipment. 
      
      During my undergraduate, I focused mainly on software engineering by taking many software courses. Specific software courses completed are listed below, 
        - Machine Learning Fundamentals for Engineers (ELEC 400M), Real-Time System Design (CPEN 432), Deep Learning (CPEN 400D)
        - System Software Engineering (CPEN 333), Data Structures and Algorithms for Electrical Engineers (CPSC 259)

      Additionally, I created a deep learning model for my Capstone project. I am fairly familiar with C++, C, Python and assembly programming languages.
      Also, I have experience with MATLAB, Altium, CAD and various electrical equipment such as multimeter, oscilloscope and soldering iron.

            - Labeled images manually using CVAT to ensure custom annotated data is consistent.
            - Trained a deep learning model (YOLOv4) noting loss, mean average precision (MaP) and testing scores to see improvements over revisions. 
            - Analyzed the training and testing data to improve the model performance and to prevent overfitting.
            - Communicated progresses of the project to clients professionally and taken feedback in tunning the model.
      - title: FreeRTOS Task Scheduling
        tagline: |
            - Implemented SRP and EDF with CBS Server task schedulers in C with FreeRTOS as the base code. 
            - Collaborated with other teammates on GitLab for implementation strategies and code reviews to ensure efficient and correct implementations. 
            - Documented the entire code base with Doxygen to verify the code is well documented. 
            - Coded with MISRA C:2012 coding standard to validate code is safely implemented.
